# AI Avatar Test Harness - Improvements Summary

## 🎯 **Double-Checked and Enhanced Implementation**

After reviewing the existing codebase and provider interfaces, I've significantly improved the test harness with proper integration and advanced features.

## 🚀 **Key Improvements Made**

### **1. Enhanced Provider Integration**
- **Proper Event Streaming**: Implemented `EnhancedMockProvider` that follows the actual provider interface from `providers/base.py`
- **Structured Events**: Generates proper `safety`, `analysis`, `subtitle`, and `intent` events with correct schemas
- **Advanced Intent Detection**: 
  - Counter-offer detection: "grant...access...withdraw...troops" → `COUNTER_OFFER`
  - Ultimatum detection: "ceasefire...or else" → `ULTIMATUM`
  - Default proposals for other diplomatic text
- **Confidence Scoring**: All intents include confidence scores and detailed rationale
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies diplomatic terms (trade, alliance, ceasefire, etc.)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral

### **2. Realistic Avatar Animation**
- **Enhanced Video Source**: `EnhancedVideoSource` with proper facial features
- **Dynamic Expressions**: 
  - Speaking animation with mouth movement
  - Eye blinking and facial expressions
  - Background gradients and professional appearance
- **High Quality**: 640x480 resolution at 30 FPS
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to black frames on errors

### **3. Professional UI/UX**
- **Modern Design**: Gradient backgrounds, card layouts, hover effects
- **Real-time Statistics**: Session count, message count, intent count, connection time
- **Enhanced Test Interface**:
  - 6 pre-built diplomatic scenarios with expected outcomes
  - Custom message input with Enter key support
  - Click-to-send utterance cards
- **Advanced Logging**:
  - Color-coded event types (intent=blue, subtitle=orange, safety=red, analysis=green)
  - Timestamp display and automatic scrolling
  - Log export functionality for debugging
  - Log size management (keeps last 100 entries)

### **4. Comprehensive Testing & Diagnostics**
- **WebRTC Testing**: Connection state monitoring and diagnostics
- **Microphone Testing**: Audio level detection and access verification
- **Integration Tests**: Complete test suite covering all components
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages

### **5. Structured Logging & Monitoring**
- **JSON Structured Logs**: Using `structlog` for professional logging
- **Correlation IDs**: Session tracking across all events
- **Performance Monitoring**: Connection timing and event statistics
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health` endpoint with system status

## 🎭 **Avatar Features**

### **Visual Elements**
- **Face**: Centered circle with skin tone and subtle animation
- **Eyes**: Properly positioned with realistic proportions
- **Mouth**: Animated based on speaking state (open/closed)
- **Background**: Professional gradient with subtle variations
- **Expressions**: Different states for neutral, speaking, thinking

### **Animation States**
- **Speaking**: Mouth opens and closes with sine wave animation
- **Listening**: Neutral expression with subtle pulse
- **Transitions**: Smooth changes between states

## 💬 **Diplomatic Testing Scenarios**

### **Built-in Test Cases**
1. **Counter-offer**: "We'll grant trade access if you withdraw troops from Ohio Country."
   - Expected: `COUNTER_OFFER` with military/economic exchange
   - Confidence: ~0.87

2. **Ultimatum**: "Ceasefire now or else we'll declare war!"
   - Expected: `ULTIMATUM` with clear consequences
   - Confidence: ~0.92

3. **Diplomatic Proposal**: "I propose we establish a fair trade agreement between our nations."
   - Expected: `PROPOSAL` with mutual benefits
   - Confidence: ~0.75

4. **Diplomatic Concern**: "Your recent actions have been most concerning to our alliance."
   - Expected: Analysis of relationship implications

5. **Strong Demand**: "We demand immediate reparations for the damages caused."
   - Expected: Demand classification with compensation requirements

6. **Cooperative Approach**: "Perhaps we could find a mutually beneficial solution to this dispute."
   - Expected: Cooperative proposal seeking compromise

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **Provider Interface Compliance**
- Follows the exact `Provider` protocol from `providers/base.py`
- Implements proper `stream_dialogue()` method signature
- Returns correct event types: `ProviderEvent` with proper schemas

### **WebRTC Enhancements**
- Proper `MediaStreamTrack` implementation
- Error handling for video frame generation
- Connection state monitoring and reporting
- Audio track handling with blackhole sink

### **YAML Protocol Support**
- Proper YAML serialization/deserialization using `ruamel.yaml`
- Schema validation integration points
- Event structure matching existing schemas
